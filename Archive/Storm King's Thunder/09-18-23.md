- we head north
    - a narrow tunnel with knee height water and low ceiling
    - pushes through cobwebs
    - looks like the old ruins of asscarl, maybe an old chapel
    - spiders ffs

- slarkathel looks corporeal/ethereal

- west room time!
    - fucking water elementals

- we walk out into the main room
    - marrow, sea hags, humans, duergars the cultists, are all decrepit and exhausted
    - the mist around slarkathel has turned to frozen fog
    - hecatin has shocked awake
    
    - manuel yeets the mindflayer and throws the crown
        - slarkathel dissipates into 

- we run to the crab
    - and sail our way out of there
