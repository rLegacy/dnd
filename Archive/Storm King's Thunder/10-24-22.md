# we just defeated the orcs at the farm house
- we toss the house
    - it is not an orc house
    - we toss the place
        - scrounge up 102 gold
        - a bunch of typical pelts and shit
            - looked like the orcs were planning on staying here through the winter
        - we interrogate the orcs
            - no one's coming
            - they were delivering them east
            - `lall` speaks up and volunteers to take us to where they were going to deliver the prisoners
            - we send the human captives on their way with two hog-tied orcs in tow
                - `lall` is warming up to us
                    - he's seen the prince angry and he's quite hot
                        - he emanates heat constantly
- we travel for a good long while
    - we creep through the woods and they open up a tiny, tiny bit
- we are near a wooden, makeshift, fortress
    - walls 15-20 feet high
        - walkable, with watchers on the walls
        - light coming through and emenating from the other side
        - one of the bondfires seems to be moving
        - can hear the steady flow of water, the river flowing through
        - the gate looks thinish, looks weak, not meant for defenses

- 2 figures are on the edge of the cliff overlooking the campsite
    - orky

- `manuel` sees a giant with robes that are flickering
    - has a maul on his hip
    - helhound by his side
    - no additional orcs in the campsite that are visible
- we battle
    - it was eassssssy
        - easy moneyyyyyyy
    - we didn't kill `prince ginrog`, but we did knock his bitch ass out.
