# Presumably, the fire trial
- door says "what fire does not destroy, it hardens"
- it's soggy in here
- to the right there's an alcove, that seems like a well
    - theres an object at the bottom of the well
        - its a turny valve
        - there's a small cupboard down there with 4 keys
            - we take the keys
- there's magma in the next room
    - we jump across and shit emerges from the magma
    - they clap our cheeks, fire elementals

- we come out into a hallway with a wood door and an almost industrial looking door
    - wooden door:
        - spinning disk with a black and white dizzying pattern
            - looks like it's coated in some sort of substance
            - small alcove in the wall with an eye that darts back into the wall
                - inside is an illusory version of solomon's farm
                - we dispell magic scroll, it does jack shit
        - continuing through the doors, we go through multiple air locks and come across a translucent tube
            - boiling water aquarium type deal that opens out into a large, oval type shape
            - the steam begins to swirl, and we roll initiative
                - they are "invisible"
                - we clap their ass
- third wall
    - "before you see a rainbow, it has to storm"
    - short rest
