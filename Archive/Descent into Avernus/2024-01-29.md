# we are tailing this ass hole


letter from dragon cultists:
```
The Thoine-Hhune vault was a perfect place to secure the artifacts: out of sight and mind for Zariel, but still on the fast track to exactly where Arkhan wanted it. Today though, a complication – that blasted Dead Three Cult kidnapped Satiir Thoine-Hhune and raided their vault. I doubt they even know what they took.

----------------------------

I buried my feet in embers and communed with Arkhan today. He passed me a message from Tiamet. You know it’s serious when our Queen gets involved. I am to lead the others to secure the artifacts. She will need them when she escapes her prison and reclaims her domain. A glorious day on the near horizon. When I pulled my feet and rejoined this plane I felt a pull. Arkhan has given me a guide. He is no “Arkhan the Cruel” to his faithful.

----------------------------

I feel like such a fool. Since Arkhan gifted me this connection to the artifacts I could not figure out why it felt as if the pull was attempting to split me in half… but of course. They’ve separated the Mask and Crown. 

----------------------------

I’ve traced the first artifact to the nice bathhouse with the bathing nymph statues. When I entered and purchased a bath Arkhan’s pull felt as if it was trying to drown me in the tub. They must be hiding it below. I’ve instructed Glasgow to investigate the bathhouse further tonight as I follow the opposite pull.
----------------------------
It's the cursed Vanthampur’s. The second artifact is in Vanthampur Manor. The 3 patrols of guards are well-disciplined, which makes them vulnerable. All I had to do was time it right and I was able to sneak right past them, no one the wiser. The artifact is in the crippled man’s room with him. The pull wanted me to go in and kill him there and take it, but I was able to stave it off. We must attempt to retrieve the artifacts simultaneously or surely they will alter the playing field.
----------------------------
Glasgow didn’t return last night, I assume he is dead.

No more time for planning, we go today. Bathhouse first, then we take on their manor.

I’ll see them all dead, a gift for Arkhan. I should like to see them beg for mercy for an eternity.
