# 23rd of ches: @ temple of gond
`valetta` is taking us to meat `nim`
new lock on `nim`'s door
`nim` can't leave the temple grounds
- they're a puppet man
- `pearson` convinces them to open the door
- before us is `nim`
    - `nim` did in fact build another nimblewright
        - it ran away
        - `valetta` is having the acolytes destroy all of the evidence
        - one of the acolytes pull out a one foot long metal contraption with an umbrella protruding from the end
            - `nim` reacts strongly to it
                - he stops abrubtly
                - its a tracking device
                - `valetta` will give us 500 gold to find and destroy the other nimblewright

- the whirlywig
    - it's crazy

# we go to the police station
- `barnibus` and `saeth`
- `reshall`

avenues:
- wander the city, w/ maxine
- wander the sewers
    - talk to volo/flune/etc... about sewers
- do we need to speak w/ `davil` about the separatists, and the trade federation (the fucking automatons)
    - the separatists were chasing the gnome!!! allegedly
- going back to city watch and try to find out more about the gnome
    - we ask the city watch if they've uncovered the identity of the known target
        - city watch sees the pin `bru`'s wearing, and "assumes hes trustworthy" and our reputation makes them believe

- `[bookwyrm's treasure]`
    - `pearson` shakes down `bookreader`
