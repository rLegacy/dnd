        Eight years. Today marks eight years on this forsaken rock of an island! In those eight years, I have learned nothing of what I was sent forth to study. This stone. This rock. It emanates so much power and yet I know not what fuels it or what purpose it may serve. All I am sure of is it is a relic from another plane. It must be. 

        My presence here feels more of folly with each passing hour as I continue to grow more and more numb. Now, more than ever, I think back on my boyhood in Waterdeep. It is the noise, I now miss. The people and general clamor. When I first arrived on Abbey Isle, I admired the peace. The tranquil breeze passing across my face blown up from the ocean with little more than the lapping of waves to distract me. I used to consider it a blessing. “My thoughts and studies are free now,” I would say to myself, young, naïve. Now the lapping waves taunt me.  

        As I reflect on eight years here, I am struck by what I have learned. Though I have learned nothing of consequence of the Animator’s Stone, I have learned a great deal about people; particularly those who gain Oghma’s favor. It is remarkable to me how foolish many of them are. 

        We are taught that the gold ring in our pupils grows as we become more knowledgeable. Oghma himself is said to have nearly completely golden eyes, but not quite. A metaphor… there is always more to know. I have never met anyone with more than the thin band of gold around their pupil though. Perhaps, another untaught metaphor… there is always so much more to know.  

        Yet, even in conjunction with my own continued failures, I cannot help but feel that I am surrounded by fools.  

        For hours, every day, the acolytes and even the clerics study necromancy. The ancient rituals and spells that extol dark magic. Somehow, they think that WE, the High Priests of Abbey Isle, have gained a knowledge unknown to generations of necromancers before us and that we simply… choose not to share it? What verse of Oghma would lead you to that conclusion? What plane of existence would a devout follower of Oghma not sing of new knowledge from the mountaintops?

        My distaste for Captain Bjorn and Sanbalet grows with every encounter. A necessary evil, I tell myself, and in truth, that’s likely accurate. The loot they bring us to fence is often of high quality and they’re willing to sell it for cheap. No one suspects the temples of Oghma to be moving stolen goods, so our margins are high.  

        I have no qualms moving the stolen brandy or silk or even weapons at times, but I do wish they would stop bringing me the proposition of moving young people like cattle. I know that knowledge is our highest priority, but I wish for Oghma to bring me the mercy of ignorance in this matter. 

        As long as our donations remain so high, the Temple of the High Table seems to respond more quickly to my requests for information (to everyone’s surprise). It is said that a new land appeared from the countryside. They claim to have been ruled by a Vampiric Warlord known to be dead for some 300 years. There is much scoffing of this story, but I should like to learn more. Such an area of effect spell that potentially could subsist for so long is of great interest to me and my research.

        The last visit with Captain Bjorn left a pit in my soul. He all but threatened us, saying that we were in no position to not help them move their product. Thank Oghma for the Animator’s Stone in this instance. While it remains a mystery to me, there is no doubt that its power over the Skull Dunes helps to keep us safe from invaders. Either way, I have contracted someone to come and discuss battle strategies with our guards to err on the side of caution.  

        Mr. Swin arrived today, and I fear I may have been a little too loose-lipped with our purpose here. I do always feel the need to correct someone when they call us necromancers though. We are all aware of the stigma it holds, and that it is illegal throughout the empire. That said, he did not bat an eye. I suppose that’s a skill a mercenary must hold, composure.
