# Residents of `[Saltmarsh]`
- Colonel Adolpho `Blanton`
    - asshole
    - boss of `Rudolph`
    - "The Last Hero of the Northern Front"
        ```
        The story is about a soldier fighting for the kingdom in the most recent northern excursion. In a hard fought battle he was hit with a fireball that kills his mount. The horse lands on him, shattering his leg and hip and leaving severe burns on his side. As the opposing army pushed the kingdom’s forces back, the soldier is left for dead. The soldier manages to drag his leg out from under his horse. Then, behind enemy lines, he crawls miles to reach the enemy camp, where, one legged, he eliminates a patrol and sneaks into the enemy general’s tent, killing him in his sleep. He steals a different horse and rides back to his own army. The soldiers name… Adolpho Blanton.

            The last visit with Captain Bjorn left a pit in my soul. He all but threatened us, saying that we were in no position to not help them move their product. Thank Oghma for the Animator’s Stone in this instance. While it remains a mystery to me, there is no doubt that its power over the Skull Dunes helps to keep us safe from invaders. Either way, I have contracted someone to come and discuss battle strategies with our guards to err on the side of caution.  


            Mr. Swin arrived today, and I fear I may have been a little too loose lipped with our purpose here. I do always feel the need to correct someone when they call us necromancers though. We are all aware of the stigma it holds, and that it is illegal throughout the empire. That said, he did not bat an eye. I suppose that’s a skill a mercenary must hold, composure.
