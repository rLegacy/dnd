    - can feel the radiation of dispel magic on your boots
    - slippery room w/ spikes
        - ez pz

- hallway w/ 2 doors
    - north
        - 2 ft off the floor there's a stream seemingly suspended in mid air
            - 6 kayaks
            - etched under the river is the calm before the storm
            - through the tube of water, we find a lightning filled room, w/ a bunch of god damn skeletons
