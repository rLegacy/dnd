# THE EYE OF THE ALLFATHER
- who or what or why is the ordening broken

- harshag walks over to the cliff edge and kicks a rock, we don't hear it hit the bottom
    - he thinks this may be a different plane
    - one of the tell-tale signs of the ethereal planes is the mists and dream-like state we find ourselves in
        - basically the fringes of the material plane
            - god's don't live here

- we stand before this giant curved entrance, the eye of the all father, home of the oracle of annam

        - hill giant w/ rock
        - frost with tree
        - cloud giant flying amongst the birds
        - storm giant hurling lightning bolt
        - stone giant climbing the pillar
        - fire giant smithing
    - there's no doorway, just a vast hallway, 40ft wide and 40ft tall

- everything is covered in frost, as we get deeper we 20ft ledges rise up to either side of us, giant sconces lighting as we walk by
    - a lot of the stonework is intricately covered in art
    - there's a giant stone block hanging back behind us, meant to seal the temple
        - perfectly set to block off the hallway

- giants fighting dragons is sculpted into the large granite doors
- three dead bodies, humanoid, are at the top of the stairs
    - they died of exposure
- find an iron amulet with a purple diamond shaped gem in it

- we heave the door open and peer into the room

- thick frost clings to every surface of this 100 ft high vaulted chamber

- 7 giant statues in the room, each holding a weapon, offering it to annam
- it looks like the frost giant is holding something, but there's nothing there
    - we should probably replace that

- annam holds a giant staff and shield

- hill: bone great club
- stone: stone boulder
- frost: empty!!
- fire: iron great sword
- cloud: some sort of spear
- storm: trident

- there's a glowing archway with something written on it and 6 runes around it
    - If ye seek to cross this border, Start with low, end with high, From the hills, to stormy sky.â€™
