# we recover after a short rest
- we push forward through the woods at a slow pace
- we track the giant a little ways, but night is falling

- we set up camp and try to ride out the night
    - we get attacked by yetis
        - we fuck um up
- the giant tracks start to merge together with other types of tracks
- the harshag tracks are fresher than the human 
- we push through the wooded area towards a ravine and head down it
    - we start to hear some metallic noises coming from ahead
        - a makeshift orc encampment
            - a group of humanoid individuals gathered around a fire, they appear to be captives
            - slavers
            - like 10 of them?
            - we fuck um up
    - we loot ~20 gold
- harshnag comes jumping down from the cliffs and greets us
    - he was tracking the slavers, trying to find their homebase
    - he's a frost giant
    - he's been trying to figure out what was going on since the `ordening` broke
        - basically the giant cast system created by the all father
            - he could "feel" it break
            - it seems that giants are now shaken out of their complacency
                - most of the giants are positioning themselves, vying for power both internally and externally
                - ~2-3 months ago, but within the last year
            - there was some order after the `ordening` was broken, but as time went on it started to shake, but it all went to shit when king `hekaton` disappeared
                - he was the king of the storm giants
                - both him and his wife, `neri` are gone
                - they ruled out of the `maelstrom`
                - he has a compatriot, a work friend
                    - `zephros`
            - there's a fire giant who's been running a slaving operation up here
                - he had heard rumors that the fire giant lord is attempting to build something that he needs slaves for
                - prince `genrog`, the fire giant prince, has been sending slaves back to `duke zalto`, his dad, the king
- after an hour or two walk, we make it back to `[farmville]`

- meet back up w/ `harshag` and look for `genrog` on our way to meet up `zephros`
