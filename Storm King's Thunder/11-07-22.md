# the loot
- 10 slaves survived
    - very similar to previous captives, farmers from the outskirts
    - they've only been here a few days
    - they've seen some slaves shipped off, down the river
- we toss the place
    - lots of camp materials, food, clothing, etc...
- `ginrog`
    - 300 gold
    - fire emblem insignia
    - big ass maul
- his tent:
    - bracelet in his tent
        - it's magical


# the interrogation
- `Harshnag` wants to execute `ginrog`
    - What are you making? Why does it require slave labor?
        - an army, for too long the giants have remained docile
        - for too long the giants have been afraid of hecatin, but now he's gone
        - the humans have been quite helpful, what we're working on wasn't designed for folks of our size
            - he's very focused on manuel, sounds like they're trying to build more warforged
            - asks what makes `manuel` tick
                - says `manuel` would love to see what they're working on
                    - it's not done yet, but you'll see the product of the creation forge soon
                    - says a little birdie told him where `[the mountain]` is (`iyrmryth`)
        - there's no stopping the wheels they're already in motion
    - Any theories on why/how the ordening broke?
        - the storm and cloud giants gave up their post as the strength of giant culture, they sat back and watched us shrink, annam is sending us a sign
            - this should lead to the second coming of `ostoria` (the giant civilization)
    - Who's your homie?
        - When's he gonna be back?
    - Any thoughts on what's going on with the stone giants?
        - He doesn't fucking care
- `Harshnag` cuts his head off
- we head back to `[miribar]` w/ the gang

# we head straight to lord tullund
- we have to wait ~40min
- we tell him about the refugees
- rumors `dryland` has returned to town

- ask about compensation for our deeds
    - when I awake I find 3 greater health potions from `lord tullund`

- mr. `dolf` will give `manuel` info about warforged in the city

- identify the bracelet as the bracelet of mockery

- `manuel` goes to speak to `chopper` a warforged blacksmith in the undercity
    - he came to `[miribar]` ~20 years ago
    - naturally an engineer, got in to blacksmithing
    - came off the north road
        - between the mines of `[miribar]` and `[miribar]`
        - does contracting for the city guard
    - he knows of a few warforged in town
        - baker friend, `neemo`
        - works with another warforged named `cal`
        - gets a business card

# we head to `zephros` and and `harshnag`
- `zephros` is quite concerned about the fire giants finding the forge
    - he thinks he's found the `[eye of the allfather]`, or at least the location where the trail starts
        - he thinks he could find the start of this trail
        - `harshnag` cannot fly
        - he wants to take the sky in `gravul`

- `solomon` tries to use the guiding hand to lead us to the `[creation forge]`

- winged boots to `manuel`, wand of magic missiles to `solomon`

- `brach` skywrite a message to `lall`
- we make it to camp

- the `[valley of cadron]`

## we move along the ridge looking for signs
- we travel 2 days and manuel gains one level of exhaustion

- beginning of the third day we see a little beached area that appears to be trodden upon
    - we're nearing the point in the river that seems like the farthest boats could make it
