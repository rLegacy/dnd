I am the Apex of creation and I will not sit ideally without exacting revenge for my kin that have been murdered and my parents’ whose corpses are desecrated and made into thrones for Hekaton’s fat ass to sit in.Change is coming in this world. Both in the heavens and on earth. Once I reach the final form promised to me, I will envelope this continent in an eternal thunderstorm."
