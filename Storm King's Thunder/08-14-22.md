# we go w/ sirac to meet slug
- we head out at dawn and it's fucking cold
- lucky we brought `markham` or we woulda got lost
- as the sun wakes from its slumber we realize camping in this weather would be damn near impossible and we arrive at the farm house

# `driscal`'s farmhouse
- no giant to be seen
- `driscal` is v cranky
- after an hour giant's here


# slugs here
- he told us yesterday, he wants to talk to `sirac`
    - "this one claims to have been to the eye, ask him where it is"
        - `sirac` says it's a tall tale he told people
        - `[the eye]` is apparently an old giant's temple
        - `slug` overheard this from some of `sirac`'s friends, on the road
    - "how did he even know about it?"
        - `sirac` says he doesn't wanna say
            - he heard about it from a professor he trades with, professor `stin`
        - we tell `slug` about `stin`
    - "ask `sirac` about where the `stin` is"
        - in a cabin
    - "he wants to take `sirac` w/ him"
    - the cabin is east of here, along the road from here and bremen

- we fight
    - good fucking god we've got synergy
    - we beat his ass
    - large rocks in one pouch
    - other pouch has 500gp, some sort of potion, a bag of dust

- we bind him, when we wakes we tell him he's coming with us to professor `stin`

# the road to the professor
- we head back toward town, around town, and toward `[bremen]`
- we ask about the eye and giant history
    - the eye is an old giant temple, the eye of the allfather, annam
        - the frost giants don't know where it is
        - they're hoping to find philosophical answers lost around the great war
            - he's dumb
        - his friend `drufi` is also looking for the eye
        - its the dust of sneazing and choking
    - he's mad at us meddling in giant business
    - fang and bite are the pet wolves
    - he won't disclose the location of `[svardborg]`

- the road to `[brenen]` is far less traveled than the road to `[bryn shander]`
    - we start to get lost...
    - but then we find the path!

# professor stin's cabin
- a shitty shack, with a small pool of water surrounding it, seems like it's on a small island, there's a small walking bridge to go across
    - an individual comes out of the shack, professor `stin`
        - in early 50's, short beard
    - he welcomes us into his home

- he mentioned the eye in passing to `sirac`
- he breaks out some ollllld giant texts
    - talks about the difference between the old runes and new runes, etc...
    - both `slug` and `stin` are interested in the eye

- we (I) unbind `slug`, and we all sit around a fire talking about the eye
    - there is a frost giant wearing a massive elk skull helmet
    - from the same area, there's a giant wearing full plate and a dragon helmet
        - that brings up an old memory of `solomon`'s, that's the classic garb of `harshnag`, the greyhand giant
            - a waterdavian and part of the kingdom's task force
    - basically he talks about the activity he's (`stin`) heard about, and thinks `harshnag` could be helpful with all this

- we go into the cabin and `stin`s got a nice map of the ten towns and the surrounding area
    - he points to an area south of `[bryn shander]`, towards the mountains
    - he confirms the eye exists, it's the home of the oracle, blah blah
    - we long rest
    - if we're gonna go after `harshnag`, we can't bring horses

# TODO:
- develope plan to let slug go
- go see what's up south of `[bryn shander]`
- buy a map
