# we wake up after a mid sleep at stin's, he's got a set of good quilts
- bye `slug`

- we head to town...

- `trevor` the cardiologist sells us some maps
- giants not in any rush to do anything

- get paged by the church
    - father `dars` have something he wants to ask ~us~
        - goes into a story about `joyra`, a halfling female, and worshipper of torn
        - about a year ago, she became more involved w/ the northern alliance
        - some of the members in `[bryn shander]` were making her uncomfortable
        - she had either outgrown his council, or just didn't want to be associated w/ a member of the church
        - about 1-2 months ago, she skipped town with some other members, and he never found out why
            - a couple days ago, he received a letter from her, she's in `[mirabar]`
            - the northern alliance members south of the spine are much more militant

- `gdemetrius` big chillin at the `[manticore's tale]`
    - he takes us south ish
    - he's fucking cold blooded

# here we are in the south ish
- we move through this tunnel esk thing of trees
- it would be prettier if it wasn't raining

- we come across a sheer rock face

- WE GET ATTACKED BY CATS
    - THEY AREN'T GOOD AT ROLLING DIE

- we climb to the top, fucking easily
- `solomon` climbs up a tree, mulan style, waste of time

- we see a much harder to track trail in the tree tops
    - that being said, we get on the trail
    - and we walk

- we see a broken down campsite, and hear some gnawing
- we notice some very large wolves that are chowing down on some giant bodies
    - they scary
    - while they were eating the corpses, we aren't sure if these are the giants' wolves or not
    - they breathe ice
    - they damn near killed us
    - but they didn't
    - FUCKING SPELLS AREN'T AFFECTED BY GRAPPLING, JUST PUNCH THESE BITCHES...do the math on 2d12 vs 2x1d8+4
