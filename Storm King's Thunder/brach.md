1. Is Brach a good person? Does Brach think he is a good person?
    - hmm, I think this is a good sticking point. leaning yes with a want to help those who can't help themselves as he once was. see 2
    - there would probably be inner turmoil here, a contradiction between wanting to be good and not caring about the means to get to whatever end is the current goal
2. Does Brach get satisfaction in helping the helpless?
    - while I don't think he has been, leaning in to wrestling the troubles others can't wrestle for themselves feels like a good trait to pick up
    - play this up w/ a certain disdain towards the helpless as well? "they can't even figure out how to help themselves" / "these idiots need to be taught" type deal
        - "well lyra, what did you think was going to happen when you joined an extremist group? you really thought the radicalization stopped at handing out pamphlets?"
3. What types of arguments does Brach respond to: pathos, logos, ethos
    - 70/30 logos/pathos with an appeal to ethos having the opposite of the intended effect
    - never having really benefited from a local/national gov or church combined with the authority figure he knew being the circus owner would ~ rule out ethos
4. Would Brach consider himself an individualist or a collectivist?
    - individualist with a certain sense of might makes right, or at least that he needs to acquire the might to make his right
    - "no one will help me but myself"
5. Would Brach consider himself a leader or a follower?
    - a leader of just himself i guess, idk
6. What would you say is Brach strongest value?
    - inquisitiveness
    - strength to forcefully fix his problems
7. Does Brach have any personal regrets from the campaign?
    - I don't think so
8. What gave Brach the most satisfaction in the campaign?
    - wrestling slug to save poor old man driscal
    - finding lost knowledge in the giant ruins
9. What would Brach be doing if he wasn't adventuring? What does his alternative life look like?
    - working on potion making, not for the pursuit of money, but some nebulous goal I never really thought out. some legendary unreachable goal potion or brew? elixir of life type shit
    - traveling around doing semi witcher stuff, in fact this is a great sort of idea to form this around, a geralt sort of "good"
        - make this the defining motivation? traveling around helping people with the terrible beasts that crop up because he is strong enough to, w/ potion making being more of a backseat thing?
10. What is Brach biggest fear?
    - with a general lack of attachment to anyone/thing, it'd probably be death
    - this feels like a mistake in char design, lack of family/emotional ties to much
11. Who does Brach like more: Manuel or Solomon? Why?
    - Manuel
        - his search for knowledge combined with brach's general lack of buy in to the authorities solomon has devoted his life to
12. What does Brach think about himself when he looks in the mirror?
    - how far we've come from the circus freak turned guild errand boy
    - damn boy he thick
    - kind leads to the issue that there isn't a good reason why brach wants to get stronger...no motivation for it
13. Brach's backstory is fairly traumatic? How has this influenced his personality?
    - is it? I guess his hyper low-class circus upbringing would influence his lack of respect for authority
    - loss of his father/suffering and abuse of his fellow circus workers would lead him to want to help others who can't help themselves
    - idk, kinda got stuck on those two through this whole thing
