# Nycaloth and the funky bunch
- we're crouched inside the parapet

- we find 4 elves, 2 male, 2 female Taf, Fin, Ky, and Tam
    - scouts for loudwater
        - sent by lord myrin, captured by hobgoblins
        - the hobgoblins worshiped that bitch boy
- the altar has some sorts of bones, for some sort of ritual, this is a new addition to the courtyard
- we investigate the rest of the place
    - it's fucking gross

- we find the elves gear and 201gp

- this place feels very defensible
- after about a day, we start to hear a low level thunder ringing in the distance
- harshy and gang show up
- colonel `spears`

- manuel sees a black mass creating a bulge in the river
    - not too far, tomorrows nightfall
    - forces look mostly undead
    - some stone giants speckled throughout
    - in the middle, towards the back, 4 stone giants carrying a seated throne
    - column of orcs marching w/ them w/ bright blue paint smeared on their faces
    - some rams, some ladders
    - 4-5k army

- solomon: gives a speech
- myrin: gives a speech

- it's fucking go time
