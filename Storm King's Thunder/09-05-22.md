# we head back to where harshnag was
- he isn't there but we follow his obvious trail
- a shadow gets cast over us and there appears to be a blue dragon flying high in the sky above us
- ~ 4 hours later we come upon `harshnag` sitting on a tree stump
- this is actually the `klauth` vale and it's his territory, and he's a red dragon
    - sightings aren't common, he very old
- `harshnag` lost the trail
    - he knows they're heading east
    - maybe a bunch more orc raiding parties as we head eastV
    - or they're out here because they're on the DL
    - we're a hard days hike from some austerian ruins

## we head towards the ruins
- we travel all day and night
- by first light, we've been going for 24 hours, and have started to turn north-ish, kinda starts to be an uphill dirt road, that turns into dilapidated steps, that turns into a BIG stair case
- looks like a caved in building of some sort, very ornate and intricate stonework, but very overgrown
- we stand in front of a relic of the old world, a massive fountain in the middle of a court yard, bugs swarming around the still water
- stone carving in front of the fountain of crossed hands held downward, `harshnag` tells us that's the symbol of the all father, the runes say "destined to rule"
- we descend down into the darkness

# the dungeon below
- it's very humid and damp down here, w/ lots of cobwebs
- we're moving through cobwebs that make us feel cold
- we battle a big worm and some spiders, easy
    - manuel finds golden yellow topaz and a violet garnet and some sort of wand

- not a gaht damn cobweb in this bitch
- looks like a library, but looks pretty rad
    - 2 categories of books...
        - some of them are all rationing information, record keeping
            - this used to be a refugee center during the war
            - the other is war accounts
                - transcripts of what's going on in the war
                    - one catches `manuel`'s eye
                        - an account of someone about `iyrmryth`'s attack on the mountain, and her destroying the mountain (warforged homeland)
- we stumble into a grand chapel
    - broken down alter
    - broken pews
    - cobwebs everywhere
    - a grand spiders nest before us
        - they hurt us, but we kill um
- this room looks familiar, yet giant
    - we search the room
        - `Brach` finds a small container buried under the dilapidated shelves
            - in it, what appears to be a super hero mask
        - a lot of religious texts for annam
            - a scroll that is some sort of correspondence to whomever was the priest here, with the phrase "the eye of the all-father"
- gtfo
- `grishnag`'s set up camp
    - we look beat up, and he says, maybe it's time to head to mirabar and find `zephros`
