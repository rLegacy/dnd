# extra special cabin edition

- `manuel` heads over to the beachy area to scout around
    - no boats or anything non-natural
    - footprints and hoof prints past the tide line
        - the hoof prints are much larger than a regular horse
            - they seem to be bipedal
        - 15 yards to the side there are giant tracks
- he tracks the trail onward, north along the edge of the `[lurkwood]`
    - we follow in his stead

- it looks like the trail crests on this largish hill, and that's as far as he can see
- when he gets to the top of the hill he sees it descends into a barren plain at the foot of an enormous mountain, with very large iron doors built into the mountain side
    - looks like there's a staircase on the side that rides up the mountain, and there's something built into the mountain up above as well, maybe thatched roofs?
- harshag gets one look at the iron doors and says he isn't feeling great about this
- `mt hammerhost`

- as we wait, we catch sight of something flying in the sky
    - a mother fucking chimera, it flys into the mountain and disappears, must have a nest up there.

- we cross the plains...it looks like they're really old, steps built into the mountain, 10-15 ft wide, as we stand in front of the steps we can tell they go 300-400 ft up
    - `manuel` begins his assent, he gets 150 feet in the air and is above the door, 150 more feet up and he starts to hear animal noises, he can sees that the wall on the mountain side has a large indent
    - he gives the indent the jukes, its about 30 feet of an indent, looks back and doesn't sense any sort of movement
- the wind is howling and a fog starts to overtake his vision
- he rounds an edge area and now appears to be under where the roofs were but there's stone walls built up, a little bridge, and a gate (the outer edge of a mini village)
- he doesn't notice any guards or people keeping watch, its just a normal looking gate, locked from the inside
- he goes to poke his head over the wall and has to do a stealth check
    - he sees a small village with hay roofs, woven in with heavy sticks
    - ~8 buildings (houses) on the side he's looking on, can't really see the other side
    - doesn't see anyone out and about, but there's a field that's planted and cared for
- he comes back down

- we go beat up the chimera
- we search the area
    - 120 copper
    - 45 silver
    - 4 relatively nice gemstones, amethysts
    - little broken music box
    - obsidian bladed dagger
    - plated helmet that has gold plate on it and gemstones
        - royal guard's

- we head up to the gate, we hear the creaking of a wooden mechanism, a water wheel
- `solomon` knocks
    - we hear some movement and a language we don't really understand
    - the movement accelerates and then the gate mechanism opens the gate
    - standing before us is a yak-humanoid
        - 8 ft tall and carrying a massive great sword
        - `Carth`
    - older yak lets us in, `chief cartha`
    - he takes us to his home
        - has many wives
            - `nahala`
            - `imbrue`
        - a few human servants
            - `melaina`
            - `mary`
        - `yaz` is in there too

- the drink is not sitting well in `solomon's` stomach
    - he passes out
- another yak guard walks in the door
    - they drugged solomon, stole our shit

- we short rest then go gank the other side of the village
    - we capture `baz`

- we search right side of the village
    - a dwarf and human slave in cages
    - fancy bead necklace
