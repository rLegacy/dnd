# we head to the undercity
- its grand and dwarven
- lots of built-ins
- academy is on the first layer
- parts of the river flow through and if we were to look for the grand dame it'd be docked down here

## the academy
- two large, metal double doors
    - symbol of mauradin carved into it
    - smaller door to the right side of them is the actual door you use
- we enter into a large lobby
- a stout dwarven woman stands behind the desk
    - she's standoffish
- a middle aged gnome scholar shows up, prof. `wasteer`
    - he shows us to his office, it's kind of a maze getting there
- `manuel` asks him about the stronghold and `iyrmryth`
    - this is the first record of `iyrmryth` in the war
        - she would have been a very young lady
        - she's been spotted all around, sometimes north of mirabar
    - ask what he knows about the eye of the allfather
        - giant temple, rumored to be in the spine of the world
            - built in to the spine of the world to be closer to anam
            - we show him the text of the tale of tracking down the eye
                - he runs back to his back office and starts drawing on his map
                    - he worked w/ prof `styn`
                    - text references the gozurt river, the ancient name of the mirar river
                    - references the valley of candroon, which is east of miribar along the gozurt river, between the lurkwood and the spine
    - a young boy knocks at the door, we have a letter
        - its from capn `baldeer`
            - we have a standing reservation for whenever w/ lord `tullen`
    - we'll be at the polite banjo tonight...if you want to grab a drink

## we peep the docks
- v small docking bay so if you aren't moving cargo, you got money
- we see the boat
    - large wooden barge
    - slots of the underbelly for rowing
    - can't help us w/ getting a job
        - need to be vetted by capn `nevlin` (captain of the boat)
        - `wagner` would be good to talk to

## we go talk to tullen
- after an hour we get seen
- lord `tullen`: mid 30's, black hair, doesn't really look the part, is tired
- mr. `dolf` is his advisor
- `tullen` only cares about the orc and fire giant raids (slavers)
- don't bother him with NA shit, it isn't his lane

## on the boat
- we gamble
- we get a note from `viv`, "follow me at a distance"
- we follow `viv` at a distance
    - we end up at the back of an alley
- she asks how `joyra` is
- we ask how she is, and she starts crying
- she tells us the same thing as `joyra`, then says she thought this was going to be a more democratic political movement, and she feels like she's in a terrorist cell
- she won't be safe unless we can handle `oosith`
    - he's the one she's been reporting too for the kraken society
    - met him a few times in alleys like this
        - when she joined the society she was doing normal canvassing
        - `oosith` is the reason she was on the grand dame, to seduce young nobels
        - he had an interest in certain ones
        - they in the sewers, fishmen

# next:
- we leave, heading to the church to hook up joyra and viv and then get them out of town
