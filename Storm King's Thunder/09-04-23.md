# we go to under the sea
- we head to the harper district and find our lt. stroot and welcomes us aboard the intrepid (a fast and unassuming vessel)
- qualeesh is here to teach us the inerworkings of the crab
- we dock for an hour at the whalebone islands when uther emerges from the sea
- he throws a pouch to samuel, contains a rough drawing of `[ascarle]` that shows us the entrance we should be shooting for
    - hard and swift right into the belly of the beast
    - the krakens minions range from merfolk to marrows to dire sharks
- we sail through the night and the hand begins to point down, its time to go

- into the crab we go
- 1: tail extends
- 2: front windows
- 3: side windows
- 4: extends the claws
- 5: crabs them
- 6: accelerate
- 7: pitch down
- 8: lights
- 9: descend
- 10: lever seals it

- we make it into the tunnel in ~13 minutes
- health was ~195 hp for the hull
    - it takes 64 damage
    - 119
        - 6
    - 113

- we climb out into a tilted room and hear yelling
    - LIZZARD FOLK
    - the crab fucking gets another crab

- we find a strange door with ancient markings of the sea and a cubic gap in the middle of this door
- we find a cubic thingamijig on the casters neck
- the door opens and leads into a hallway
    - the castle is fucking shaking
    - we start to hear gutteral chants echoing through the stone
    - they grow louder as we approach
    - a strange looking room with torches and chanting individuals
        - one of them collapses as its life force is drained by the ritual
            - a slimy brown mound slowly rises and falls, it's glowing
            - the ethereal essence is trying to pull away from the mound
        - to the south is a raised platform
            - robed mind flayer
            - also in a white orb
            - striking away pieces of the crown of annam
            - stabs it into the chest of a disheveled storm giant `hecatin`
        - the east is dark water
        - there's a crystal ball pedestal behind the guy
