- `manuel` sees two figures coming towards us, they look very large
    - two giants
    - as they get closer, we can tell they're stone giants, and they look quite ragged
        - we offer them oatmeal
            - they eat
            - they thank us immensely for telling them about the giant ruins we found, they've been walking for 10 days

        - "things are getting really bad here guyssss"
        - not just the northern alliance
        - when she got here, me and viv and ali, there was a lot more of a secretive group than she had anticipated
            - a lot less focused on the politics, a lot more focused on...something else
