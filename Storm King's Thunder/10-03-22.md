# we escort viv to the temple
- we head back to get our armor while manuel follows viv to the temple
    - we meet back up with them
    - `joyra` shows up after about an hour
        - `solomon` points her in the direction of `viv`
        - we send them with a trade caravan down south

- we go down into the sewers
    - we find emergency drains
        - we activate that shit
    - we fight some fish
    - then a big tentacle boy comes out and tries to eat us
        - we kick his ass
    - we head down stairs
        - there's a guy who knows who we are
            - he doesn't look like 4 eels in a trench coat
            - its `oosith`
                - the tentacley creature's name was `martin`
                - as `oosith` was falling through the water, manuel noticed, there was no splash
                - 4 pin wheel handles near us and a lever to the north and south
                    - the water looks much deeper than downstairs
