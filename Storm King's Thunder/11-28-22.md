# death to the yak folk
- we open our side of the gate
    - we see 4 yak folk, bows knocked (1 being `yaz`)
    - `chief cartha` in the front, hand on his sword
        - 5 servants behind him
        - 2 wives behind him

- we get the hostages in exchange for not destorying the water mill
- we start to head back to harshag w/ 7 humans and `baz`
    - we unbind `baz`
    - the watermill is a standard grain mill that also operates the elevator into the mountain
    - that's about it

- both of `chief cartha`'s wifes are priestesses
    - we leave with our tails tucked between our legs

- we get back to the river bed and on top of the cliff is `zephros` tower

- `timothy` is the most cogent of the slaves
    - we give him a letter 

# we head to the location of the eye
- `zephros` brings the tower down in a barren, coniferous forest
    - it's beautiful weather
- we long rest

- we set out, searching for the eye of the all father

- after ~ 5 hours we come across a smaller, almost corridor that might be the pass
    - we hike up it for another 4-5 hours, we can feel the altitude change
    - ~300 yds in front of us is a large opening into the mountain

- we head in
    - cold is emanating from the opening
    - it's fucking icy
    - there's a bit of a glow
        - not from the sun, but from a sky of incredibly bright stars, before us is a massive valley of sheer rocks, and a giant staircase that emerges up the valley
    - we pick out the eye of annam in the fake sky star
    - a giant rune on one of the stairs says beware
        - even
        - heroes
        - will
        - fall
    - it's weird that we don't feel tired
        - time is frozen
        - the night sky hasn't changed
    - we find ourselves on a narrow bridge with no railings
        - there's no frost
    - the domed entrance to an ancient building stands in front of us
        - frost here
    - as we take another step forward, we enter an anti magic field of sorts
    - the stone bridges pattern changes very abruptly 
    - in each of the grid squares there's a giant number
    - will catches the answer to the puzzle, EVEN numbers hurt
    - we stand before the entrance to the eye of the all-father
        - as we get to this side, our magic items start to work again
