- keep nate in the loop about creative ideas and goals
    - keep it on fucking rails

- we can ask nate if a character or detail is important

- if something's getting complex, let's narrow it down immediately

- a ton of travel time in the campaign
    - plan our routes a decent amount

- we're in the northern sword coast

- Kessler `Stroot` asks us to come to `[Bryn Shander]`
    ```
    I do not know if it is my right to ask but I am humbly requesting a favor. My former commanding officer in the Northern Guard, Markham Southwell of Bryn Shander, has recently contacted me about the increase in giant activity in the Savage Frontier. He is requesting a company of soldiers from the Empress's Royal Army to reenforce the Northern Guard. Unfortunately, her Majesty's army is stretched too thin at the moment with skirmishes in the south and the continued occupation of the Bavorian Valley. However, Markham is a proud Northerner and generally unflappable man so his fear greatly concerns me. Which is why I am writing to you...because of this potentially dangerous situation and your reputation for navigating such things. It would be considered a favor to both the crown and myself if you were to accept this journey to our northern border and meet with Markham. It is of great importance and urgency that this issue is uncovered and resolved. Please let me know your response as soon as possible. We can discuss compensation in person.


    Your Friend,
    Lt. Kessler Stroot

        The Mountain crumbles and the world becomes shrouded in shadow.
        The forge has cooled and my brethren froze.
        The iron veins are brittle and breaking
        Where is the smithy now?
        Who will save us? 
        Are we worth saving?
