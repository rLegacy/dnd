# we head towards the temple of gond
- as we approach, we are greeted by the temple hands
- we DO remember that `valetta` did ask us to come back after we dispatched the second nimblewright
- `valetta` comes down and says hi
    - `nimb` confirms that we DID it
    - she pulls out a pouch and hands it to `bru`
        - a "lot"
            - 501 gp
    - 4 items on the table (we get them all)
        - a pair of small poles that have straps on the top
            - adjustable stilts
            - increase height 2-5ft
            - weight 8 lbs
            - 1 ft long
        - a backpack
            - met the maker in the bar, gnomish girl, `Amorette`
            - a parachute
            - "backpack parachute"
            - have to use your reaction, need 60 ft for it to slow you down enough
        - 6x6x6in metal cube
            - has a little crank on the top
            - if you crank it, it'll be active for 8 hours
            - it'll bark if it detects vibrations ()
        - a very beautiful wooden pipe
            - requires no matches
    - we ask `valetta` about the map
        - name doesn't mean anything to her
        - not likely the nimblewright made it, it was given it

AND THEN IT ENDED
