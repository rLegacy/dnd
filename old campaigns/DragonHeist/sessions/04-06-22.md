# 24th day of ches of the year 1566 dragonsrein
- sitting in the wild boar decompressing and thinking about our interview w/ `dalakhar`
- candice has taken the lead on finding candidates for replacement doormen
- door opens and a red haired, very average looking man, walks in, `ranaer` is here!
    - he's a member of the `mirt` crew, the harpers
    - his fathers' spys continue to hound him, and `dalakhar` was one of them
        - `dagult` trusted `dalakhar`
            - he was on a mission to find the stone of golorr
                - feared the `zhents` and `xanathar`
    - we go see `fallefalier` at the `[carellians crown]`
        - ask them if they saw anything
        - a cloaked man took something off the body of a dead gnome then limbed away
            - they were headed in the direction of `[the bent nail]`
                - came towards t4 and cut through the alley toward t2
    - we head to `[the bent nail]`
        - `tally felbranch` has been having a blast working on godslayer
        - he left during the raucusness
        - didn't see shit
- we head into the sewer entrance near our house...

## the sewers
- we head south, run in to 2 duergars
    - one of the grows real big!
    - `pearson` sees a ten spoked wheel on one of their shoulders, symbol of the `xanathar`
- we continue south
    - the sewer curves around and we come to a tunnel
