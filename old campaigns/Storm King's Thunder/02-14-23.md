                    Our troops will march out once we are given direct orders from the Storm Giant Lord Ratos. They are currently dealing with Slarkrethelâ€™s forces under the Trackless Sea. (the coast) If Slarkrethel breaches then the coastal cities may fall without proper defenses. I understand the threat of the Dragon is imperative but `Ratos` has communicated that Slarkrethel is a dangerous and magical creature not to be underestimated.
