# Aftermath of the siege

- `zephros` shows up moments after the battle
    - his grandmother gave him the tower

- the leadership group is planning on moving all of the troops back to loudwater

- perhaps she wants the souls to ascend to godhood or something

- a lot of cave openings in the canyon, ignore them all
    - once deadstone is in sight, peel off the river
        - hill to the left, w/ 3 holes, petrified stone giant hole is money
            - middle?
    - you'll end up on the left side of the river, and the temple is on that side as well
    - no fire through the foothills

- we head toward dead stone cleft

- we box some orcs and continue traveling
    - petrified stone giants embedded into the rocks

- we think we spy dead stone cleft
    - we go in the left tunnel and follow it. it's straight and there's a glimmer of light in the distance

- feeding schedule or routine

- massive casket in the chamber, with a robed figure standing in front of it, we try to sneak up on him
    - it doesn't work
