    ```
    This small paperback book falls open in your hand to the table of contents and your eye is immediately drawn to the section titled: “The Seat of Death.” You quickly flip to it and read about a god named the Raven Queen, who has never showed her full form to any mortal. The goddess uses ravens on this plane to communicate with mortals, thus her moniker and her symbol of a raven’s head in profile. She is the keeper of the dead and detests necromancy. She is also the keeper of memories, which has often put her at odds with Oghma, God of Knowledge.
