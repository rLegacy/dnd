we open in a messy room with rusted, useless things

# Session Start
we come across 6 tattered, straw stuffed mattresses strewn across the room

we come across two people one is a short, very dark skinned, kinda dwarf, duergar (known for dwelling in the underdark) and a bald human with eye tattoos all over his head

`pearson` is proficient in recognizing hate speech

`penny`'s shield and glaive were corroded by the ooze, -1 ac and -1 damage

threadbare curtains hang on east wall,

half orc stands on chest of red haired human with fire in clenched fist

there is a nightmarish figure with tentacles and shit (mindflayer with an intellect devourer)

we fidn alfred peabody, they do brewing and their home is right above us
they live in `[fish gut alley]`, in the `[dock ward]`

the mindflayer was asking after the stone of golorr.

anytime we need to contact ranaer, he'll be at the yawning portal and his home (location unknown)

holds out a scroll tube that's the deed to a property in the north ward, wants to give that to us as payment instead, for a place called troll skull manor, rumored to be haunted.

a woman named albaya, cleric, woke up `ranaer`

push `volo` for info about the intellect devourer and mind flayer
- they're dangerous creatures
- have their own goals and machinations

we arrive at `[troll skull alley]`
- a 4 story building with balconies, a turret, and five chimneys

meet with a tiefling magistrate named `kylin silverhelm`, who witnesses the transfer of the deed, and the house is ours

`steamin steel` a good blacksmith around here
