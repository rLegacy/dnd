we open in a messy room with rusted, useless things

# Session Start
we come across 6 tattered, straw stuffed mattresses strewn across the room

we come across two people one is a short, very dark skinned, kinda dwarf, duergar (known for dwelling in the underdark) and a bald human with eye tattoos all over his head

`pearson` is proficient in recognizing hate speech

`penny`'s shield and glaive were corroded by the ooze, -1 ac and -1 damage

threadbare curtains hang on east wall,

half orc stands on chest of red haired human with fire in clenched fist

there is a nightmarish figure with tentacles and shit (mindflayer with an intellect devourer)
