# off we go
- we move the horses and go down a trap door 20ft
- we find a thin wooden door
    - muffled, rhythmic sound coming from the other side of the door
    - the door is behind a tapestry

- cultists facing a raised platform

- cicero slides out invisible to check things out
- we bop um, the devil disolves into ash when he dies

- the angellic form of zariel stands on a pedestal
    - runes that are inscribed in infernal on the pedestal
        - "that which falls can rise again"

- we came through the avernus tapestry

- smooth stone trenches cut into the floor channel water and waste about

- 2 cultist hang a sensor between them, incensing the place

- we find a dry cellar filled with barrels
