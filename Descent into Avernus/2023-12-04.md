The Dead Three, also known as the Dark Gods,[1] was a collective of three, death-themed deities: Bane,[2] the Lord of Darkness;[3] Bhaal, the Lord of Murder; and Myrkul, the Lord of Bones.[1] Originally, they were powerful mortal adventurers[4] who sought the path to godhood and were known as the Dark Three.[5] They found it in the form of Jergal, who acquiesced to their demands as he was tiring of his life as god of the dead. He gave up his portfolios to the three of them, apotheosizing them in the process. Bane ruled tyranny and strife, Bhaal became the god of murder, and Myrkul was lord of the dead.[4][6]
They earned the name 'Dead Three' when they all perished during the Time of Troubles in the mid—14th century DR. Bane and Torm killed each other in Tantras; Myrkul was killed by the mortal mage Midnight; and Bhaal was slain by Cyric using the sword Godsbane, an avatar of Mask.[7]

        In the name of Bane, we offer adulation to Zariel, Archduchess of Avernus. In the name of Bane, we give the blessing of one god to another. In the name of Bane, we give blessing unto the unholy conquest of Eltruel. In the name of Bane, we offer adulation under the fear and tyranny born in her name.

            ```
            Flennis,
            Know ye that these missives pass through holy hands directly from the Shield of the Hidden Lord, which speaks with the True Voice of Gargauth, Once Lord of Avernus and Treasurer of Hell, the Tenth Lord of the Nine, the Hidden Lord, the Lord Who Watches, and Legatus of the Dark Gods.

            When the devils of Avernus brought down Elturel, the Grand Duke of Baldur’s Gate was claimed as a prize for Hell. So too shall you claim for Zariel the souls of those who once served Elturel. You can know this to be truth, for I hold here, at Vanthampur Manor, secure within its infernal puzzlebox, the pact with Zariel; the declaration of the powerful purpose to which we set our hands. Lay to rest your doubts.
