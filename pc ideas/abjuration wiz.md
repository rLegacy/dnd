    - Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
    - Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.

Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells, and you don't require material components when you cast them with this trait.

# Backstory
- Merlin & Archimedes: In ancient times these two were the greatest wizards to ever roam the lands. Both determined to ascend to godhood and achieve immortality, they took two different paths to the same goal. Archimedes went the direct route, ascending in a few short centuries, where Merlin devised a plan to make his soul immortal; ensuring he would always reincarnate into another body after death. Archimedes has followed Merlin on this journey over countless lifetimes. After a few disastrous attempts at guiding these reincarnations, Archimedes has resigned himself to a more passive approach, befriending the countless reincarnations of his long lost best friend.

Enter Cornelius Dogene, a young? old? idk... dwarf, descendant of a legendary artificer, and on the path of wizardry merlin took all those millenia ago. Archimedes saves him from X (context specific danger) and they are bonded, Archimdedes taking his classic owl form as Cornelius' familiar.
