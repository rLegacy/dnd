    - Age: 20
    - Size: Dwarves stand between 4 and 5 feet tall and average about 150 pounds. Your size is Medium.
    - Speed: Your base walking speed is 25 feet. Your speed is not reduced by wearing heavy armor.
    - Darkvision: Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
    - Dwarven Resilience: You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
    - Dwarven Combat Training: You have proficiency with the battleaxe, handaxe, light hammer, and warhammer.
    - Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with the artisan's tools of your choice: smith's tools, brewer's supplies, or mason's tools.
    - Stonecunning: Whenever you make an Intelligence (History) check related to the origin of stonework, you are considered proficient in the History skill and add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.
    - Languages: You can speak, read, and write Common and Dwarvish. Dwarvish is full of hard consonants and guttural sounds, and those characteristics spill over into whatever other language a dwarf might speak.
    - Warder's Intuition: Whenever you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check or an Ability Check involving Thieve's Tools, you can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the total ability check.
    - Wards and Seals: You can cast the Alarm and Mage Armor spells with this trait. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast the Arcane Lock spell with it. Once you cast either spell with this trait, you can't cast that spell again until you finish a Long Rest. Intelligence is your Spellcasting Ability for these spells, and you don't require material components when you cast them with this trait.
