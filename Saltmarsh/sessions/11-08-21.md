first time taking notes...format will develop with time

# a recap from last session
- broken out of "jail" by `Patrick Swin` and `Mierka`
- `Patrick Swin` was hired to train the residents for defense
    - he got here right before shit hit the fan
    - wants to get the fuck off the isle
- `Mierka` doesn't seem to keen on killing the others as she's a loyal member of the cult of `Oghma` who inhabit this isle
- `Mierka` doesn't like `Oliver`, who has fallen into power due to organizational structure

## first night in `[crypt]` 
- `Exo` decided to run ahead, fell in pit of acid
- `Kell` valiantly jumped into the pit to save me <3
- `Guy` caught a ballista to the face, used magehand to open doors juking other ballista
- `Guy` rolls a critical save to get up while we had no idea he was bleeding out, absolutely epic
- BALLISTA SHOOT STICK!!!, TAKE NOTE THIS MAY BE USEFUL WHEN CONSTRUCTING BOAT
- `Mierka` is about damn useless, cleric with no healing, just casts searing flame and stands around (she did use shield of faith which is nice)
- we took a lot of damage, need to reset for the next night
- used all spell slots on good grapes, `Swin` returned gear to hiding place
- returned to "cell" to long rest

here begins the first day of note taking
```

- 

# second day of captvity
## during the day
- prisoners locked in a cell:
    - fucking `kell` gave away 20% of our booty
    - `guy` had a dream again of someone elses memories
        - he was a rat, first non-humanoid dream
        - may have an idea of what we're looking for, it's deep within the tunnels
        - something in a box that makes bones return to life, including fucking skeleton rats, FUCK!!!!
        - `guy` persuaded `exo` to continue the quest for the box
        - it's officially `primwater`
        - we can't sell it
            ```
            We would like you to lead an expedition to clear out the island and return any undead abjurations to Our Lady Death. Also scout and see if the location may make for a good place of worship to erect a temple to any of our High Table allies.
            ```
        - `guy` also saw something that indicates the cult of `oghma` brought it here
        - we're being put to work...
## work!
- fishing
    - `guy` calls fishing second
    - rolled a straight which means val x 4
    - he catches 2 tunas
- hauling water
    - `kell` calls hauling water first
    - put in a cauldron in a room he hadn't seen before
    - only person in there was `Kyla`, half elf woman we had met before
- hoeing the garden
    - `exo` gets stuck with the hoeing
    - the artist formerly known as the garden has grown and we need lots of food
    - straight lines start going wonky...seems like he's looking at a giant maze for just a second

## post work
- last all day, brief break where they expect us to feed ourselves with gutgrapes
    - they do feed us turnips
    - they think `guy` loves them
- we can smell them cooking the tuna `guy` caught
- `kell` noticed the clerics casting spells on the tuna
    - `oliver` casts
        - gentle repose
        - purify food and water
- `oliver` comes to see us carrying `exo`'s stick
    - calls `exo` over and asks about stick
        - exo tells him he doesn't know anything about it
    - tries to burn stick in fire, doesn't fucking work
    -`ribs`, half orc, big boi, is "guarding" us
    - captain `zidler` is the "pirate guy" who hired us
    - `guy` had a vision from the "raven queen" and was told to use the mage hand to open doors
    - there was a balista, he was lying about the vision

## second night in `[crypt]`
- `swin` knocks and comes to get us
- we decide `exo` needs his stick
- `guy` will set out with the stick
    - asks `mierka` where he should go looking
        - she says go look in `oliver`'s room, where we were kept before
    - he listens
        - room is extremely quiet
    - he tries the doorknob, it's unlocked
    - he sneaks into the room and investigates
        - `oliver` is sleeping with other girls, `exo` is so upset
    - he comes out and asks what we should do
    - we killed ~~natalie~~ earlier `kelly`
    - `mierka` would side with the cult
