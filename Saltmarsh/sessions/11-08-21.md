first time taking notes...format will develop with time

# a recap from last session
- broken out of "jail" by `Patrick Swin` and `Mierka`
- `Patrick Swin` was hired to train the residents for defense
    - he got here right before shit hit the fan
    - wants to get the fuck off the isle
- `Mierka` doesn't seem to keen on killing the others as she's a loyal member of the cult of `Oghma` who inhabit this isle
- `Mierka` doesn't like `Oliver`, who has fallen into power due to organizational structure

## first night in `[crypt]` 
- `Exo` decided to run ahead, fell in pit of acid
- `Kell` valiantly jumped into the pit to save me <3
- `Guy` caught a ballista to the face, used magehand to open doors juking other ballista
- `Guy` rolls a critical save to get up while we had no idea he was bleeding out, absolutely epic
- BALLISTA SHOOT STICK!!!, TAKE NOTE THIS MAY BE USEFUL WHEN CONSTRUCTING BOAT
- `Mierka` is about damn useless, cleric with no healing, just casts searing flame and stands around (she did use shield of faith which is nice)
- we took a lot of damage, need to reset for the next night
- used all spell slots on good grapes, `Swin` returned gear to hiding place
- returned to "cell" to long rest

---

```
here begins the first day of note taking
```

# second day of captvity
## during the day
- prisoners locked in a cell:
    - fucking `kell` gave away 20% of our booty
    - `guy` had a dream again of someone elses memories
        - he was a rat, first non-humanoid dream
        - may have an idea of what we're looking for, it's deep within the tunnels
        - something in a box that makes bones return to life, including fucking skeleton rats, FUCK!!!!
        - `guy` persuaded `exo` to continue the quest for the box
        - it's officially `primwater`
        - we can't sell it
            ```
            We would like you to lead an expedition to clear out the island and return any undead abjurations to Our Lady Death. Also scout and see if the location may make for a good place of worship to erect a temple to any of our High Table allies.
            ```
        - `guy` also saw something that indicates the cult of `oghma` brought it here
        - we're being put to work...
## work!
- fishing
    - `guy` calls fishing second
    - rolled a straight which means val x 4
    - he catches 2 tunas
- hauling water
    - `kell` calls hauling water first
    - put in a cauldron in a room he hadn't seen before
    - only person in there was `Kyla`, half elf woman we had met before
- hoeing the garden
    - `exo` gets stuck with the hoeing
    - the artist formerly known as the garden has grown and we need lots of food
    - straight lines start going wonky...seems like he's looking at a giant maze for just a second

## post work
- last all day, brief break where they expect us to feed ourselves with gutgrapes
    - they do feed us turnips
    - they think `guy` loves them (the turnips)
- we can smell them cooking the tuna `guy` caught
- `kell` noticed the clerics casting spells on the tuna
    - `oliver` casts
        - gentle repose
        - purify food and water
- `oliver` comes to see us carrying `exo`'s stick
    - calls `exo` over and asks about stick
        - exo tells him he doesn't know anything about it
    - tries to burn stick in fire, doesn't fucking work
    - `ribs`, half orc, big boi, is "guarding" us
    - captain `ziedler` is the "pirate guy" who hired us
    - `guy` had a vision from "the raven queen" and was told to use the mage hand to open doors
    - there was a balista, he was lying about the vision

## second night
- `swin` knocks and comes to get us
- we decide `exo` needs his stick
- `guy` will set out with the stick
    - asks `mierka` where he should go looking
        - she says go look in `oliver`'s room, where we were kept before
    - he listens
        - room is extremely quiet
    - he tries the doorknob, it's unlocked
    - he sneaks into the room and investigates
        - `oliver` is sleeping with the stick, `exo` is so upset
    - he comes out and asks what we should do
    - we killed ~~natalie~~ `kelly` earlier 
    - `mierka` would side with the cult

## we return to the `[crypt]`
- the fucking spectres are back alive
    - mr patt "portly" `swin` is yelling at people
    - we kill those fuckers
- the door seems to reanimate the spectres
- lots of god damn traps
- we hit a lot of said god damn traps
- 50ft chamber filled with alchemy tools, a desk with papers and the  southern end has an opening to another hallway
    - chest next to the table:
        ```
        The hallway widens out into a 50 foot chamber. Directly across from you there is a table covered in scattered papers and next to it a small chest. On the wall closest to you there is a series of tables next to each other with alchemical tools. At the southern end of the room there appears to be an opening into another hallway, but three figures stand silently in front of it, unmoving.
        ```
    - we encounter 1 ghast and 2 ghouls
    - found 200 (500 winky face) gold pieces
    - find a leather bound journal on the desk
        - journal of `beto` eribaun, former head of the cult
        - buzzwords inside of some shit, need more time to tell what's in it, relevant to his time on island
            - `kell` looks through it in reverse order
            - last couple passages:
                ```
                The last visit with Captain Bjorn left a pit in my soul. He all but threatened us, saying that we were in no position to not help them move their product. Thank Oghma for the Animator’s Stone in this instance. While it remains a mystery to me, there is no doubt that its power over the Skull Dunes helps to keep us safe from invaders. Either way, I have contracted someone to come and discuss battle strategies with our guards to err on the side of caution.  


                Mr. Swin arrived today, and I fear I may have been a little too loose lipped with our purpose here. I do always feel the need to correct someone when they call us necromancers though. We are all aware of the stigma it holds, and that it is illegal throughout the empire. That said, he did not bat an eye. I suppose that’s a skill a mercenary must hold, composure. 
                ```
        - `guy` investigates the alchemical devices...
            - this is a lab of some sort
            - levels of alchemy and enchantment bullshit going on here
            - in particular, though, an odd jug with a plethora of different spouts that are all corked, he picks it up and it sloshes, when he opens it, it's empty
                - the fourth plug pours honey
                - the seventh plug pours nothing at all
                - the fourth one pours honey again
                - the first one pours nothing
- 2 spectres follow us, laughing all the way
- 2 similar looking but distinctly different spectres laugh at us and dash down the north after the bend
- we sense big spooky through the door
- `guy` sneaks through the door
    - large jade statue of dragon
    - two massive looming figures

## combat with the minotaur and a ogre zombie
- `guy` leaps across the spike trap, baiting the minotaur
    - he jumps over the spike trap easily
    - he lands in a tripwire trap!! taking 18 damage
    - ogre zombie has less than 9 dc
- we beat that shit eaaaaasy!
