first time taking notes...format will develop with time

# a recap from last session
- broken out of "jail" by `Patrick Swin` and `Mierka`
- `Patrick Swin` was hired to train the residents for defense
    - he got here right before shit hit the fan
    - wants to get the fuck off the isle
- `Mierka` doesn't seem to keen on killing the others as she's a loyal member of the cult of `Oghma` who inhabit this isle
- `Mierka` doesn't like `Oliver`, who has fallen into power due to organizational structure

## first night in `[crypt]` 
- `Exo` decided to run ahead, fell in pit of acid
- `Kell` valiantly jumped into the pit to save me <3
- `Guy` caught a ballista to the face, used magehand to open doors juking other ballista
- `Guy` rolls a critical save to get up while we had no idea he was bleeding out, absolutely epic
- BALLISTA SHOOT STICK!!!, TAKE NOTE THIS MAY BE USEFUL WHEN CONSTRUCTING BOAT
- `Mierka` is about damn useless, cleric with no healing, just casts searing flame and stands around (she did use shield of faith which is nice)
- we took a lot of damage, need to reset for the next night
- used all spell slots on good grapes, `Swin` returned gear to hiding place
- returned to "cell" to long rest

```
here begins the first day of note taking
```

- 

# second day of captvity
## during the day
- prisoners locked in a cell:
    - fucking `kell` gave away 20% of our booty
    - `guy` had a dream again of someone elses memories
        - he was a rat, first non-humanoid dream
        - may have an idea of what we're looking for, it's deep within the tunnels
        - something in a box that makes bones return to life, including fucking skeleton rats, FUCK!!!!
        - `guy` persuaded `exo` to continue the quest for the box
        - it's officially `primwater`
        - we can't sell it


## second night in `[crypt]`
- don't jump in pit of acid (maybe)
