first time taking notes...format will develop with time
```
# a recap from last session
- broken out of "jail" by `x??` and `y??`
- `x??` was hired to train the residents for defense
    - he got here right before shit hit the fan
    - wants to get the fuck off the isle
- `y??` doesn't seem to keen on killing the others as she's a loyal member of the cult of `Oghma` who inhabit this isle
- `y??` doesn't like `z??`, who has fallen into power due to organizational structure

## first night in `[crypt]` 
- `Exo` decided to run ahead, fell in pit of acid
- `Kell` valiantly jumped into the pit to save me <3
- `Guy` caught a ballista to the face, used magehand to open doors juking other ballista
- BALLISTA SHOOT STICK!!!, TAKE NOTE THIS MAY BE USEFUL WHEN CONSTRUCTING BOAT
- `y??` is about damn useless, cleric with no healing, just casts searing flame and stands around (she did use shield of faith which is nice)
- we took a lot of damage, need to reset for the next night
- used all spell slots on good grapes, left gear in entrance to crypt
- returned to "cell" to long rest
