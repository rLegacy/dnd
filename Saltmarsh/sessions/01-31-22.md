                        - ```You find a large black leather-bound book and open it to discover a handwritten fairy tale with illustrations drawn into it. Captivated by the beautiful artwork you are drawn into a story about young Princess Nightshade. She is young and bright and beautiful, and as people do, she falls in love with a handsome prince in a neighboring kingdom. They wed, and she must move to his castle, which takes her on a bendy road through the dark woods.  Her caravan is attacked by a hag, but before the hag eats Princess Nightshade, she decides that the Princess is not quite young enough after being deflowered on her wedding night. The Princess rides off out of the wood, vowing to never return. Not long after she arrives at her new husband’s kingdom, she finds she is with child and is overjoyed. The local medicine man could find no heartbeat for the child though. Distraught, the princess goes from village to village, but no one can help her. In desperation, she plunges back into the dark woods, at the heart of which, she finds the hag’s hut. She begs the hag to help her, and the hag agrees. In order to breath life into her belly though, the princess would have to give up part of her soul. A small price to pay, Princess Nightshade thinks. The hag then does a dark incantation and sends the Princess on her way. Yet, when the baby was born, it never drew breath. Heartbroken and enraged, the Princess stormed back into the wood, dagger in hand, ready for revenge. When she found the hag however, the hag cackled and took Princess Nightshade’s hand, placing it on the Princess’s stomach. Behold. A heartbeat. Stronger than anything the Princess had ever felt before. The Princess then lived with the hag in the dark woods and finally delivered the baby. The pain of childbirth, accompanied with the ripping of her soul, and when she gazed down at her newborn, she could see it was not human at all, but a small lizard with many heads. Princess Nightshade loved that child with all she had left in her soul but knew she had lost something she could not get back. As she looked upon the child, she could hear the hag cackle and then take Princess Nightshade’s hand, placing it on the Princess’s stomach. Behold. A heartbeat. ```
