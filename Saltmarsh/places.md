                The last visit with Captain Bjorn left a pit in my soul. He all but threatened us, saying that we were in no position to not help them move their product. Thank Oghma for the Animator’s Stone in this instance. While it remains a mystery to me, there is no doubt that its power over the Skull Dunes helps to keep us safe from invaders. Either way, I have contracted someone to come and discuss battle strategies with our guards to err on the side of caution.  


                Mr. Swin arrived today, and I fear I may have been a little too loose lipped with our purpose here. I do always feel the need to correct someone when they call us necromancers though. We are all aware of the stigma it holds, and that it is illegal throughout the empire. That said, he did not bat an eye. I suppose that’s a skill a mercenary must hold, composure.

            - the 4th pours honey
            - none of the rest seem to do anything
        - we find ourselves in a chamber with a large jade statue of a dragon
