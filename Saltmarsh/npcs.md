# Residents of `[Saltmarsh]`
- Colonel Adolpho `Blanton`
    - asshole
    - boss of `Rudolph`
    - "The Last Hero of the Northern Front"
        ```
        The story is about a soldier fighting for the kingdom in the most recent northern excursion. In a hard fought battle he was hit with a fireball that kills his mount. The horse lands on him, shattering his leg and hip and leaving severe burns on his side. As the opposing army pushed the kingdom’s forces back, the soldier is left for dead. The soldier manages to drag his leg out from under his horse. Then, behind enemy lines, he crawls miles to reach the enemy camp, where, one legged, he eliminates a patrol and sneaks into the enemy general’s tent, killing him in his sleep. He steals a different horse and rides back to his own army. The soldiers name… Adolpho Blanton.
